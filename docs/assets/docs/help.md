# Text2Lesson

_Text2Lesson_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into lessons. Lessons can include quizzes as well as
information about the topic being taught.

There are two main uses of the program:

- to play lessons that have been created by someone else.
- to create lessons for yourself or others.

Why would you want to create a lesson for yourself? This could be useful for
revising a topic.

You first step is probably to check out [Playing lessons](./playing-lessons).
