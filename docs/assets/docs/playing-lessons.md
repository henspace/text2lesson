# Playing lessons

Lesson can come from multiple places. These are the three main places you will
find lessons:

- Remote library. If you want to access the prebuilt lessons, this is where you
  will find them.
- Local library. If you want to create lessons for yourself, this is where you
  will store them.
- File system. If you been sent a lesson file, or create your own using an
  external editor, this is where you will find the lessons.

## Playing a remote library lesson

Predefined lessons are contained in a library. The library contains a number of
books, each of which is broken down into chapters, and then lessons. The basic
structure is shown below

- Library
  - Books
    - Chapters
      - Lessons

The steps below will show you how to follow a lesson. Note that the application
will automatically skip unnecessary steps. So if there is only one book in the
library, it will immediately jump to show the chapters. Likewise, if there is
only one chapter, it will immediately jump to show the lessons.

Follow the steps below to follow a predefined lesson:

1. From the home page, select `Open remote library`.
1. From the list of books, select the book you want to open. If there is only
   one book available, this will have already been selected for you
   automatically.
1. From the list of chapters, select the the chapter you want to open. If there
   is only one chapter available, this will have already been selected for you
   automatically.
1. Select the lesson.
