# Privacy policy

**Text2Lesson** has been designed to run as far as possible on your device,
without the need to create user accounts or provide any personal data. This
document describes what data are stored by the application and when data are
sent to the server.

## Collection of personal data

- The application holds no account details or personal information unless you
  delibrately decide to enter that information into a lesson you are creating.
- The application is hosted by GitHub. GitHub logs and stores your IP address
  for security purposes, regardless of whether or not you have signed into
  GitHub. For more information about GitHub's security practices, refer to the
  [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Data storage

- The application holds no account details or personal information unless you
  delibrately decide to enter that information into a lesson you are creating.
  Entering personal information into a lesson you are writing is neither
  required nor recommended.
- No information you enter when answering questions in a quiz is ever stored or
  transmitted to the server.
- The only data stored are your preferences for using the application and the
  text that defines any lessons you create.
- Your preferences and lessons are stored locally on your device using your
  browser's
  [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).
- Unless you explicitly decide to share your results, the results of any lesson
  are never stored or transmitted anywhere. See
  [Sharing results](#sharing-results) for more information.
- No cookies are used.
- No adverts are used.

### Cache storage

If available, the application makes use of the browser's
[Cache Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage)
to save pages downloaded from the server. This makes the application start-up
faster on subsequent uses and reduces data transmission.

## Sending data to the server

As far as possible, the application runs on your device and data is not normally
sent to the server for processing. There is one exception:
[Autorun files](#autorun-files).

### Autorun files

These files are self-launching lessons and quizzes which are designed for
sharing. When a user tries to launch one of these files, they are given the
option to run the lesson automatically. Running the lesson automatically
requires the text defining the lesson to be transmitted to the server. This is
optional, and the user will always be given the option to skip the autorun
feature and load the lesson manually.

If the autorun feature is used, the lesson is transmitted to the server via a
url, and then returned back to the client device. The application does not store
or process the data on the server. However, the lesson text is processed by the
web-hosting services as part of normal web protocol handling.

## Sharing results

Your scores for any tests are not stored on your device or transmitted to the
server unless you explicitly choose to share your results. If you do share the
results, only the lesson identification and scores will be shared. No personal
information is included in the shared results.

What happens with the results data if you choose to share it, will depend on the
service you choose. You will need to refer to the selected service's privacy
policy for information on how your results data will subsequently be handled.
