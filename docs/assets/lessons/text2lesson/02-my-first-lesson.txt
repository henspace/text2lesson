# (i) This will be a bit of a longer lesson. We're going to look at how we create our
own lesson combined with a quiz.

First, a bit of terminology so we're all on the same page.

Lessons are made up of multiple problems.

Problems come in different flavours.

* Pick the right answer.
* Pick the right answers. More than one is correct.
* Fill in the blanks.
* Put the words in the correct order.
* Watch the slideshow.

In this lesson we will just look at creating a simple multiple choice question
with one correct answer.

This lesson is under construction.
