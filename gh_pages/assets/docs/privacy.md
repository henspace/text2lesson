# Privacy

**Text2Lesson** has been designed to run entirely client-side, that is, on your
device.

# Data collection

The **Text2Lesson** application does not collect any data. Third party services
which are use to make **Text2Lesson** available may collect some data. Refer to
[Third party privacy policies](#third-party-privacy-policies) for details.

With exception of [Autorun files](#autorun-files), none of the information you
enter into the application is sent back to the server and no cookies are used.
Lesson data can be stored on your device; see [Local storage](#local-storage)
for details.

## Results

Your scores for any tests are not stored on your device or transmitted to the
server unless you explicitely choose to share your results. If you do share the
results only the lesson identification and scores will be shared. No personal
information will be included in the shared results.

## Autorun files

**Autorun** files are html files that can be opened in a browser on your device.
They contain the lesson that is to be run, but contain no personal information
unless that has been incorporated within the lesson and questions.

In order to launch the quiz from an **Autorun** file, the lesson is transmitted
to the server via a url, and then returned back to the client device. Although
the **Text2Lesson** application does not store or process this data itself, the
data are processed by the web-hosting services to make the application
available. Refer to
[Third party privacy policies](#third-party-privacy-policies) for details.

# Local storage

Your results and lessons are stored locally on your device using the browser's
[localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).
