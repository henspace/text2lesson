# Text2Lesson

This application has been designed to take plain text and convert it into
lessons. In this context, a lesson contains information about a particular
topic, interspersed with quizzes.

The application has been written to maximise user privacy, so no information is
transmitted or stored on a server; everything runs client side.

So what's the point? There are three ways it's envisaged the application will be
used:

- to run any of the lessons included in the prebuilt library.
- to run lessons created for your own use; this might be for revision purposes.
- to create lessons to share with students, quickly and simply and without the
  students needing to create accounts or provide any personal information.
