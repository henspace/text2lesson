      This is an emergency repair page for <em>RapidQandA</em>. It will delete
      everything that has been stored by the program. Absolutely everything:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your settings &mdash; GONE!</li>
      <li>Any quizzes and lessons you've written &mdash; GONE!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you're running this because your memory is corrupt and you need to
      start again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but hopefully this will get
      you back up and running again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're running this because you just don't get the program, I'm sorry
      <em>RapidQandA</em> wasn't for you, but thanks for having a go.
    </p>
