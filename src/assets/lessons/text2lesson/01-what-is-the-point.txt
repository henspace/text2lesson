# (i) _Text2Lesson_ has been designed to create lessons and quizzes quickly and 
painlessly just using plain text. 

There are a lot of online quiz generators out there, such as Quizziz and Kahoot,
so what is the point of something else?

_Text2Lesson_ has been designed so that anyone using it can do so without needing
to create an account or provide any personal information. If you are creating
content for your students, you can do so safely knowing that neither they nor you
will need yet another online account.

The guide you are currently watching has been created using _Text2Lesson_. Let's
use it to ask some questions.

If you find the speed at which these slides automatically advance too slow, you can
increase the reading speed by clicking on those three bars at the top left, and
selecting settings.

* x Slido

# (i) Okay. That was a very, very short lesson â€” we're just looking at some of the 
things _Text2Lesson_ can do.

This will automatically move on to your certificate for this quiz. You can then
move on to select the next lesson.

By the way, given you were only asked one question, the certificate is not going
to be very inspiring emoji:grinning
