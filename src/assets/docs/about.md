title: 'About Text2Lesson'
---

_Text2Lesson_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into lessons. And when we talk about lessons, we also mean
quizzes that can accompany the information being taught.

If you want to follow a lesson, we refer to that as _playing_ the lesson.

There are three main uses of the program:

- to play lessons that have been created by someone else or from the built-in
  library. The built-in library is underconstruction at the moment, so you'll
  have to wait a bit. Sorry!ðŸ˜¥
- to create lessons for someone else to use.
- to create lessons for yourself or others.
