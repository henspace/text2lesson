# Privacy policy

**Text2Lesson** has been designed to run on your device, without the need to
create user accounts or provide any personal data. This document describes what
data are stored by the application.

## Collection of personal data

- The application holds no account details or personal information.

## Data storage

- No information you enter when creating or playing a lesson is ever stored or
  transmitted to the server.
- Unless you explicitly decide to share your results, the results of any lesson
  are never stored or transmitted anywhere. See
  [Sharing results](#sharing-results) for more information.
- The only data stored are your preferences for using the application and the
  text that defines any lessons you create.
- Your preferences and lessons are stored locally on your device using your
  browser's
  [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).
- No cookies are used.
- No adverts are served.

### Cache storage

If available, the application makes use of the browser's
[Cache Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage)
to save pages downloaded from the server. This makes the application start-up
faster on subsequent uses and reduces data transmission.

## Sharing results

Your scores for any lessons are never stored on your device or transmitted to
the server unless you explicitly choose to share your results. If you do share
the results, only the lesson identification and scores will be shared. No
personal information is included in the shared results.

What happens with the results data if you choose to share it will depend on the
service you choose. You will need to refer to the selected service's privacy
policy for information on how your results data will subsequently be handled.

The following mechanisms for sharing results are provided. Not all devices
support these features, so some options may not be availbable to you.

- Email: this option merely opens your email client, if your browser has been
  configured to open `mailto` links.

- Share: this option uses the
  [Web Share Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API).
  This allow the application to share results using the sharing options provided
  by your device's operating system. The privacy of your data will depend upon
  the privacy policies of the option you select.

## Third party privacy policies

- The application is hosted by GitHub. As is common for most web servers, GitHub
  logs and stores your IP address for security purposes, regardless of whether
  or not you have signed into GitHub. For more information about GitHub's
  security practices, refer to the
  [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
